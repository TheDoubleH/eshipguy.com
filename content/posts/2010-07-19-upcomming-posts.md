_&#8220;I am not dead, yet!&#8221;_

Such was a message from a poor guy in Monty Pythons &#8216;Life of Brian&#8217;.

Neither am I, but I have found myself rather busy. Anyhow &#8211; Here are a list of subject matters that I am working on &#8211; in no particular order.

  * Standard Pack
  * Putting Sound and Lights with Pack Line Scanning
  * Box Sized from a Barcode
  * Shortcut Barcodes
  * GTIN &#8211; Item Numbers for different Box sizes
  * Super Advanced Bill of Lading
