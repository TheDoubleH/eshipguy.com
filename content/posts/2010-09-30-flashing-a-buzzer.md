From time to time I do create some pretty cool stuff, so I need to brag a little.

A customer of mine, had me create some functionality that includes flashing lights and buzzers.

<!--more-->Their warehouse is laid out like a lot of ofter customer I have seen. They manufacture products that are Lot specific and therefore lot numbers needs to be recorded when shipping. At the same time they also just sell in case packs.

Using Fast Pack is not really a good idea, as entering Lot Nos. are not really happening then. Pack Line scanning seem to be a better fit as we are able to scan Lot Nos. directly.

Normally Pack Line Scanning is used when you use the small package carriers e.g. UPS and FedEx, but in this case they need to scan a fairly high number of cases, and most of them end up on a pallet. This creates an issue, where shippers will have to move a lot of cases and pallets to be close enough to the computer.

So we decided to do a few things.

We decided to add lights and warning buzzers to each shipping station. Combined with a wireless bar code scanner and we are in business!

So now, the operator can scan and get a visual feedback, and if an error occurs a buzzer will make sure he looks up and see the flashing red light.

We are in the process of creating a video, but in the meantime I will be at the Lanham Product Day in San Diego on October 2nd, and I will also be attending NAVUG in Orlando, FL on October 18 &#8211; 20, where you take get a closer look if you are interested. You can e-mail me henrik@eshipguy.com if you want to set up an appointment.
