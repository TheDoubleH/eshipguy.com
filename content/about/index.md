The E-Ship Guy is <a title="My LinkedIn Profile" href="http://helgesen.info" target="_blank">Henrik Helgesen</a>. I am a Microsoft Dynamics NAV developer and consultant. I started working with <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Navigator</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Navision </span>Dynamics NAV back in the days it ran in DOS. Originally from Denmark, but I now reside in Glendale, CA with my Wife Elana.

A lot of water have run through the river since my start in the Navision-world.

I started in 1995 working as an internal IT Guy for a Furniture Manufacturer in the northern part of Denmark, who were implementing Navigator running on a IBM RS/6000 running Unix. After working there for 2 years, I had worked myself out of a job and was <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/literally" target="_blank">literally</a> twiddling my fingers.

In 1997, After twiddling my fingers for a short while, I listed my resume on &#8216;The Internet&#8217;. A short time thereafter I received a text message on my cell phone, given me notice that I had received an e-mail (Yeah, back then we used a 28.8K modem). My employer sent me off to training and off to Lufkin, TX I went for a couple on months learning from one the best in the biz, Michael Voigt.

In 2001, I found myself in Los Angeles, CA working with a company who supplies a wide range of electronics to several large customers, by fulfilling web orders. They were implementing E-Ship and I got involved! When we went live at 12:00 noon we caught 4-5 miss-ships before the day was over ~ _I was sold!_

Ever since E-Ship have been my favorite part of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Navision</span> Dynamics NAV World.

During my career I have worked on many different companies, covering the circle of life; Adult novelties, Sperm Bank, Cord Blood Storage, Baby products (Toys, seats etc), Pharmaceutical Products, Medical Devices and Death Care to name a few.
