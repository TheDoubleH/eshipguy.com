Please e-mail me at henrik at eshipguy.com or comment on this down below if you have any issues or you have any you want to share!
As you may notice, some carriers have multiple entries. This happens, when i find better URLs. Knowing that the carriers may retire URLs, I keep older (that may be newer) URLs just forÂ reference.</description></item><item><title>On-Line Help for E-Ship</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/on-line-help-for-e-ship/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2011 02:04:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/on-line-help-for-e-ship/</guid><description>&lt;p>When you implement the E-Ship/EDI functionality in your database, you get a lot of new fields added also. A lot of those fields are added in places users already interact and as such questions often come up, as to the functionality of certain fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good thing is, that Lanham &amp;amp; Associates over the years have developed some help text, which is a good start â€“ and it is getting better and better.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NAV EasySecurity</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/nav-easysecurity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2010 20:09:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/nav-easysecurity/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just want to let you know, that I am still breathing! I have for the past couple of weeks been doing an implementation of &lt;a href="http://mergetool.com/products/easysecurity.html">EasySecurity&lt;/a>, that has taken up all my time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This customer is a public company and as such needs to adhere to SOX regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>One thing I have learned about SOX; The US Government must be jealous â€“ so much bureaucracy to do anything!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Label Buffer Files on Citrix/Terminal Server</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/label-buffer-files-on-citrixterminal-server/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 20:54:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/label-buffer-files-on-citrixterminal-server/</guid><description>&lt;p>There are different ways of handling this; one being creating multiple packing stations and Carrier Packing Stations (one for each PC), but if the only reason for doing this is to separate the buffer file, there is a better way!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Label Print Shell Command Error</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/label-print-shell-command-error/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2010 06:59:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/label-print-shell-command-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>If you ever receive the error message:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The file name â€œC:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe /c type c:\temp\buffer.txt &amp;gt; LPT1&amp;quot; contains a character that may not be used.
Please check the file name. You can find additional information on file names in the documentation for your operation system.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>you are more than likely on a newer operating system â€“ i.e. Vista. In the good old days where all computers had at least one parallel port and two serial ports, you could execute shell commands very easy. Nowadays, however, you have to pass the program and parameters separately.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blind or Double Blind Shipments</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/blindshipments/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 22:58:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/blindshipments/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this world of easy e-commerce solutions we often find us in a situation companies manage orders for other companies, and want to ensure that end customers not know about it.

I am a Microsoft Dynamics NAV developer and consultant. I started working with Navigator Navision Dynamics NAV back in the days it ran in DOS. Originally from Denmark, but I now reside in Glendale, CA with my Wife Elana.
A lot of water have run through the river since my start in the Navision-world.
I started in 1995 working as an internal IT Guy for a Furniture Manufacturer in the northern part of Denmark, who were implementing Navigator running on a IBM RS/6000 running Unix.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to the E-Ship Guy's Blog</title><link>https://eshipguy.com/welcome/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Jun 2010 21:12:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://eshipguy.com/welcome/</guid><description>Having worked with E-Ship since 2001 I, at times, feel that a lot of people thinks that E-Ship is just for printing UPS and FedEx labels. E-Ship is so much more.
My goal with this blog is to hopefully provide help and inspiration to other consultants and end-customer alike and show some of the tips and tricks I have used over the years.
